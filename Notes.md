  > I'm not aware of any CGB test ROMs affected by IPS screen replacements, but if you want to develop your own test ROMs its probably a good idea to have a stock screen available to test with.
  > On the DMG there are test ROMs that are affected by biverting the original LCD, and some LCD <=> PPU desync behaviour that might not show up on replacement screens.
